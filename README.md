Does this app look familiar? Well it should! Its the same app as Eat-tha-Pasta, but it has been transitioned to use Sequelize. What a life saver!

User's can enter in dishes they want served up and then, when ready, they can devour them. The app will keep track of what they have eaten.


Technologies Used:

Node.js | MySQL | Sequelize | JavaScript | jQuery
